# fa-en

The taggers in this repository are based on scripts from the Hazm toolkit (https://github.com/sobhe/hazm) and use the pre-trained model included in the toolkit.

The transliterator is a one-to-one Perso-Arabic to Latin transliterator. It is a modified version of a transliterator for Arabic using the Buckwalter system. The original script can be found at: https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-extras-commits/2007-June/msg03617.html
